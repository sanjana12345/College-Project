Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Network
# The project is about Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Network. 
#problem statement : Given a energy harvesting sensor network G(V u S, E) with the sensor set V and a set of potential sojourn locations S for a mobile sink, the throughput maximization problem in G is to find an optimal close trajectory for the mobile sink consisting  of sojourn locations in S and time scheduling at each sojourn locations such that the network throughput is maximized subject to a given tolerant delay T.
#Two approch for this problem is done.
# BFS Approch
#DFS Approch
